# GCD Calculator (Console Application)

This is a simple C# console application that calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers using a recursive algorithm (Euclidean Algorithm).

## 📌 Features
- Takes two integers as input from the user
- Uses recursion to compute the GCD
- Displays the result in the console
- Simple and beginner-friendly implementation

## 🧠 Algorithm Used
The program uses the Euclidean Algorithm, which works as follows:

- If b == 0, then GCD(a, b) = a
- Otherwise, GCD(a, b) = GCD(b, a % b)

This approach is efficient and commonly used in mathematics and computer science.

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Language: C#
- Framework: .NET Console Application
